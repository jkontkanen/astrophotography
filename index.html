      <h1>Astrophotography</h1>

      <p>
	I slipped into astrophotography a few years back when attempting to photograph the Milky Way with a cellphone (inspired by <a href="https://research.google/blog/astrophotography-with-night-sight-on-pixel-phones/">this</a>).  When we got into RV-camping in the midst of the 2020 pandemic I had more access to starry skies and I gradually got more into it. Without having a grand plan, I continued via Fuji X-T1 and lightweight star tracker to computerized mounts (ZWO AM5&3), dedicated telescopes (seen below), and astrocameras (ASI294mm and ASI2600mc).

	<div class="float_box"> <img src="images/z73-inset.jpg" class="img_float"></img><p class="float_caption"><p>William Optics Z73.</div></div>	
      <p>
Why do I do this? I am still not sure. Astrophotography is a time-sink and you will not be able compete with Hubble or James Webb in data quality.
      <p>
	There is something about being there yourself. When I saw Saturn from my house with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orion-10149-StarBlast-Refractor-Telescope/dp/B00FM6GMPE">tiny travel telescope</a>, I was hooked. Also, I didn't internalize how unfathomably vast the observable universe is before I got into astrophotography. Plus, processing images is an intriguing combination of art and science.
      <p>
I made this page to display the images the way I want in HDR (assuming a capable display and the Chrome browser). While astro processing is usually done in a very high dynamic range, it is still most common to map the image to SDR for final presentation. I believe HDR has potential to make astrophotography more beautiful than ever.
